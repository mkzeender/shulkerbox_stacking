# Shulkerbox Stacking

A simple, lightweight Minecraft datapack that allows shulker boxes to stack up to 64.

Shulker boxes will stack if they have the same color and same items, unless:

1. The item was created before this datapack was installed
2. The item was not obtained through crafting or mining (i.e. creative inventory or commands)

These issues can be easily solved by placing and re-breaking the box.

This datapack does not use functions, so it won't hurt the performance of the game at all.
