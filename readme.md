# Shulkerbox Stacking

A simple, lightweight Minecraft datapack that allows shulker boxes to stack up to 64.

Shulker boxes will stack if they have the same color and same items, unless:

1. The item was created before this datapack was installed
2. The item was not obtained through crafting or mining (i.e. creative inventory or commands)

These issues can be easily solved by placing and re-breaking the box.

This datapack does not use functions, so it won't hurt the performance of the game at all.

## Installing
Download the [latest release](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/stackable-shulker-boxes/) from planetminecraft and put it into your world's datapacks folder.


## Uninstalling
Remove the datapack from your datapacks folder. Any stackable items will remain stackable until you place and re-break them.
